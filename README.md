# Hiro-JS-Starter-Ticket

## Hiro Stackathon - "A Front End with Clarity" Submission
This repo is a full stack Clarity app built with Stacks.js 'React-CRA' template and my own locally built smart contract. The idea for this app is to serve as a ticketing service for a train using NFTs. For the smart contract I have a set price, a limit on the number of tickets available and a data-var that allows the company to cut off minting and transfer of tickets at any point.

## Stacks.js
The front end will allow users to authenticate, mint an NFT for a ticket, view their current ticket, or transfer their ticket to another user.
